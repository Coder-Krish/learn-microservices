## This is a repo created to learn basics of microservices using dotnet

> Here in this project I just created two services named as Customer and Product.
> I tried to keep them segregated from each other.
> With the help of API gateway, they are unified (Here I used Ocelot API gateway) 
> No Authentication and Autherization is used in this project.
